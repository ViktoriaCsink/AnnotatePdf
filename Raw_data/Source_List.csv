Australia AUSTRAC,Fintel Alliance,,"Fintel Alliance is an AUSTRAC initiative established in 2017 to increase the resilience of the financial sector to criminal exploitation and support law enforcement investigations into serious crime and national security matters.  A world first public-private partnership, Fintel Alliance brings together experts from a range of organisations involved in the fight against money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crime.  Fintel Alliance partners include major banks, remittance service providers and gambling operators, as well as law enforcement and security agencies from Australia and overseas. Working together, Fintel Alliance develops shared intelligence and delivers innovative solutions to detect, disrupt and prevent serious crime.  Financial crime guides  Fintel Alliance publishes resources to help businesses understand, identify and report suspicious financial activity to detect and prevent criminal activities.  Financial crime guides provide detailed information about the financial aspects of different crime types. They include case studies and indicators to help the financial services sector identify and detect suspicious transactions.  Businesses can use a combination of indicators in financial crime guides and their business knowledge to conduct further monitoring and identify if a suspicious matter report needs to be submitted to AUSTRAC.  Financial crime guides are developed in partnership by AUSTRAC’s Fintel Alliance, relevant government agencies, and our industry partners.  Read our financial crime guides  Fintel Alliance performance report 2019-20  The Fintel Alliance performance report highlights our major operational achievements for 2019-20.  The report demonstrates the vital role Fintel Alliance partners are playing in detecting and combating new criminal threats related to COVID-19, while continuing to support law enforcement operations against serious crimes as diverse as child exploitation to illicit tobacco.  Key achievements include hardening the Australian border to child offenders resulting in multiple arrests and children rescued from harm. Fintel Alliance has made significant contributions to the arrest of offenders for money laundering, illicit tobacco, and scams, and helped raise millions of dollars in tax liabilities.

Fintel Alliance has an established program of work based on targeting priority themes including crimes targeting our most vulnerable community members, exploitation of government revenue, disrupting professional money laundering, and crimes and threats to Australia’s domestic and international interests.  Fintel Alliance partners work together at AUSTRAC’s offices in Sydney and Melbourne, sharing and analysing financial intelligence to investigate and disrupt criminal and terrorist activity.  There are two information-sharing hubs where partners collaborate:  The Operations Hub – a physical space where partners exchange and analyse financial intelligence in close to real time, combining data with tracking tools and best-practice methodologies from their organisations. The Innovation Hub –partners co-design and test new and innovative technology solutions that assist in gathering and analysing financial intelligence at an operational level. They also assess the impact of emerging technologies such as blockchain and digital currency (or cryptocurrency). A day in the life of Fintel Alliance ",11-May-21

Australia AUSTRAC,Money laundering/terrorism financing risk assessment,,"Identifying and assessing the level of money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risk to your business or organisation is an important part of your AML/CTF program. It is the first thing you must do because it determines what measures you need to include in your program.  Assessing the ML/TF risk your business or organisation faces enables you to develop an AML/CTF program with appropriate measures to protect your business or organisation from being exploited by criminals.  Once you have identified the risks, you need to put in place controls to mitigate and manage these risks. See the risk management process section for more information on mitigating and managing risks.

Australia AUSTRAC,Suspicious transactions identified by your transaction monitoring systems,,"You must make sure your transaction monitoring systems alert you to unusual, large or complex transactions or patterns of transactions.  What defines a transaction as large or unusual will depend on the size of your business or organisation and the services you offer. It also depends on the types of customers and transaction activities you normally deal with.  Indicators of criminal activity  There are many customer transactions that may indicate your business or organisation is being exploited for money laundering, terrorism financing or other serious crime.  Examples of these indicators include:  gambling proceeds being deposited into foreign bank accounts buying casino chips and cashing them out with no gaming activity associations having multiple accounts under multiple names transactions that don’t match the customer profile high volumes of transactions being made in a short period of time depositing large amounts of cash into company accounts depositing multiple cheques into one bank account purchasing expensive assets, such as property, cars, precious stones and metals, jewellery and bullion using third parties to make wire transfers using an accountant or lawyer to make transactions using cash to buy large amounts of gold regularly selling large amounts of jewellery, gold or precious metals storing large amounts of cash in a safety deposit box cashing bank drafts for foreign currency exchanging large amounts of currency for traveller’s cheques withdrawing large amounts of cash making multiple transactions on the same day from different locations using false or stolen identities to open bank accounts repaying loan balances early or in cash describing frequent transfers of funds as loans from relatives moving funds through different accounts closing insurance policies and requesting payment to a third party sending investment funds to high-risk countries reducing (structuring) the amount of cash deposits or withdrawals to avoid triggering transaction reporting rules.  Read our case studies for more examples of indicators of criminal activity that businesses have recognised and reported to AUSTRAC.  If you are suspicious about a transaction  If your monitoring program identifies suspicious customer transactions or behaviour, you must apply your enhanced customer due diligence and submit a suspicious matter report (SMR) to AUSTRAC.  Identifying a higher ML/TF risk does not necessarily mean that a customer relationship must be terminated, but if you decide to terminate a customer relationship, continue to apply ECDD and OCDD until the termination takes effect. You can consider placing restrictions on the account to prevent further transactions.  You should continue to monitor for new accounts that could be related to the closed accounts. ",29-Mar-21
