0,Australia AUSTRAC,FATF updates on global ML/TF risk,,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global group that sets international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) standards, has published two recent updates relating to international ML/TF risk.  The reports provide an update on jurisdictions which may pose a risk to the international financial system:  High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action – 23 October 2020 – noting that the 21 February 2020 call for action in relation to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran remains in effect. Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring – 23 October 2020 – jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies in their AML/CTF regimes and are actively working with the FATF to address them.  Reporting entities should be aware of countries that pose a higher risk of money laundering or terrorism financing and use this information to help guide ML/TF risk assessments, compliance programs and decisions about submitting suspicious matter reports to AUSTRAC.  For further information, see AUSTRAC’s guidance on high-risk countries, regions and groups. ",5 January 2021

15,Australia AUSTRAC,Customer identification and due diligence overview,,"As a reporting entity, you must identify and know your customers.  Your customer identification procedures – Know your customer (KYC) procedures – must be documented in Part B of your AML/CTF program. All AML/CTF programs must include a Part B program.  To identify, mitigate and manage money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risk, you need ongoing customer due diligence processes. This includes developing and documenting an enhanced customer due diligence program and a transaction monitoring program in Part A of your AML/CTF program.  Holders of an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) who arrange for their customers to receive a designated service, and do not provide any other designated services, do not have to have a Part A program.  Customer identification and ongoing customer due diligence processes will help you identify unusual transactions and behaviour, to identify and manage high-risk customers and report suspicious matters when appropriate.  Identifying and verifying customers: Part B of your AML/CTF program  Part B of your written AML/CTF program must document in detail the procedures you use to identify your customers and verify that their information is correct. After using these ‘applicable customer identification procedures’ you must be reasonably satisfied that:  an individual customer is who they claim to be a customer who is not an individual (such as a company, association or trust) is a real entity and you know the details of its beneficial owners. Applicable customer identification procedures  Applicable customer identification procedures (ACIP) include:  collecting and verifying customer identification information through know your customer procedures identifying and verifying the beneficial owner(s) of a customer identifying whether a customer or beneficial owner of a customer is a politically exposed person (PEP) getting information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.  Your ACIP must consider, among other things:  the nature, size and complexity of your business the purpose of your business relationship with your customers the type of ML/TF risk you might reasonably face customer types (including beneficial owners and politically exposed persons) customers’ sources of funds and wealth control structures of non-individual customers types of designated services provided how you deliver these services the foreign jurisdictions you deal with.  If there is a higher risk associated with a customer, you will need to collect and verify more information to ensure you are reasonably satisfied that your customers are who they claim to be and that you are effectively managing your ML/TF risk.  Your systems and controls must:  consider the ML/TF risks identified include procedures to collect and verify information relating to a customer's agent.  Your staff and, if applicable, your agents, must understand your ACIP and you must monitor and ensure compliance with these procedures.  In most cases, it is a requirement to carry out ACIP before providing a designated service, and the designated service must not be provided if a customer cannot first meet the ACIP requirements. Not carrying out your ACIP due to customers being unhappy or uncooperative puts your business and your community at greater risk and is a breach of your obligations.  Failure to correctly conduct ACIP on customers can significantly impact ongoing identification, mitigation and management of ML/TF risks and introduce risks across all aspects of AML/CTF compliance. ",12 April 2021
16,Australia AUSTRAC,Transaction monitoring,,"A transaction monitoring program helps your business to:  Identify, mitigate and manage money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risk Identify and report suspicious matters to AUSTRAC meet your ongoing customer due diligence (OCDD) and enhanced customer due diligence (ECDD) obligations.  You must document how you monitor customer transactions in Part A of your AML/CTF program. Your transaction monitoring program must be based on your risk assessment of your business or organisation and define the processes you follow to identify suspicious customer transactions, including:  unusually large transactions complex transactions unexpected patterns of transactions that don’t seem to have a legitimate purpose.  How you monitor transactions and develop your program depends on the size of your business or organisation and your level of ML/TF risk. Depending on the type, size and complexity of your business or organisation, your transaction monitoring program can be manual or automated. You should allocate appropriate resources and priority to analysing and actioning alerts raised by transaction monitoring.  Your transaction monitoring program  You must have an appropriate risk-based monitoring program in place to help your employees identify suspicious transactions and take steps to protect your business or organisation.  Your transaction monitoring program should:  define the processes you follow to identify suspicious customer transactions document appropriate risk-based systems and controls that capture all necessary sources of customer and transaction data or information set out systems and controls that trigger alerts for further review such as: size, frequency or patterns of transactions that may indicate unusual or suspicious activity, including suspected fraud or identity theft transactions that are sent to or received from a high-risk country or region payments that are sent to or received from a person or organisation on a sanctions list activities that may be inconsistent with a customer's risk profile or history increased monitoring of higher risk customers previously suspected of or investigated for potentially suspicious activity other unexpected account activity from a customer which may indicate money laundering or terrorism financing  implement processes to consistently review and manage the internal escalation and investigation of alerts prioritise alerts according to the level of risk document processes to consistently manage the reporting of potentially suspicious matters detail sufficient assurance processes to review the management of alerts continually monitor transactions at all levels, not just, for example by branch or venue level document processes with sufficient specificity to enable them to be consistently applied document and audit any automated transaction monitoring processes. How your processes work together  Your processes and information sources must work together to monitor the services you are providing to customers to identify, mitigate and manage ML/TF risks.  Transaction monitoring, reporting, ECDD, ACIP and other information all contribute to a better understanding of your customers. These processes and information sources must contribute to a single understanding of the customer and their risk profile, rather than operate or exist independently.  Transaction monitoring alerts must be considered against the customer’s history, including any information from law enforcement. You must ensure there is a central or fully accessible customer history for customer due diligence purposes.  For example, different teams in your business might hold information about a customer’s suspected connections to terrorism, transaction monitoring alerts, suspicious activity on the customer’s account and information from law enforcement about this customer.  Your systems and controls must be able to merge and combine this information in a timely manner, to provide a comprehensive view of the customer’s ML/TF risks.  Review and assurance of your transaction monitoring program  Your transaction monitoring must be applied to all designated services at all times. It must be supported by appropriate accountability and review mechanisms, to confirm that:  processes are in place to make certain no disruptions to downstream AML/CTF processes occur when any changes are made to systems all systems changes that may potentially affect AML/CTF compliance require AML/CTF sign off all necessary assurance processes are in place and AML/CTF processes are fully documented and mapped.  Transaction monitoring must be periodically audited and reviewed to ensure it is operating as intended. Audits and reviews must confirm that transaction monitoring is based on complete data, and that transaction monitoring rules remain appropriate and current. Automated transaction monitoring systems and program alerts need to incorporate any new methodologies, typologies or crime types.  Resolving any system issues must also receive adequate resourcing and priority. This should also be addressed from the time the failure or breakdown was identified to cover all past transactions.  Any problems identified must be addressed promptly. Failure to monitor transactions can have serious flow-on effects to other AML/CTF processes such as SMR reporting, conducting ECDD and the ongoing identification of ML/TF risks. ",12 April 2021

Remittance service providers are also known as ‘money transfer businesses’.  Video: Guidance for remittance service providers ",15 April 2021
18,Australia AUSTRAC,Preventing financial crime using a risk-based approach,,"Many requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and AML/CTF Rules are risk-based.  Adopting a risk-based approach is fundamental to meeting your obligations under the AML/CTF Act, and also protecting your business and the financial system from criminal abuse.  Under a risk-based approach, you identify and assess the money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks your business faces and determine which ones are the greater and lesser threats to your business.  You can then apply your resources where they will have the biggest impact, to mitigate and manage the highest assessed ML/TF risks.  A risk-based approach recognises that ML/TF risks are not the same for every business, customer or transaction. It recognises that you are best placed to understand your particular ML/TF risks, taking into account your:  customer types (e.g. natural persons, companies etc.) products or services offered the geographical areas in which the business operates delivery channels ( e.g., over-the-counter, online).  For example, you would rely on your assessment of the risks when determining how to complete customer identification for a particular customer. Different procedures can be applied depending on the level of risk. When dealing with medium risk customers, services and situations, the level of customer due diligence and other risk mitigation would be lower than if you were dealing with high risk customers, services and situations.  Senior management oversight  Senior management must be made aware of, and understand, the ML/TF risks to your business, and decide whether the business is capable of mitigating and managing the identified risks effectively.  Documenting and maintaining your risk assessment is important to ensure that senior management and relevant employees understand the ML/TF risks.  Your senior management or board must approve and oversee the implementation of the risk-based systems and controls that are documented in your AML/CTF program. Decisions about entering or maintaining particular higher-risk business relationships, for example, must be escalated to senior management for consideration.  Why adopt a risk-based approach?  A risk-based approach is at the foundation of global best practice approaches to combating money laundering and terrorism financing.  A risk-based approach to mitigating and managing ML/TF risk means you can focus on the outcomes that the regulation is intended to achieve. That is, preventing money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious financial crimes, rather than complying with a checklist of requirements.  The benefits of this approach include:  more efficient and effective use of resources minimising compliance costs and burdens on customers greater flexibility to respond to new and emerging risks as money laundering and terrorism financing methods change. Applying a risk-based approach to your AML/CTF obligations  Where you identify ML/TF risks, you must develop and implement procedures to mitigate and manage them. A risk-based approach allows you to apply measures proportionate to the level of risk. This ensures that you can use your resources effectively.  Continually review and update your risk assessment  For a risk-based approach to work, you need to continually review and update your risk assessment. You must ensure you understand the risks your business faces, including identifying and addressing new and emerging risks. This assessment must also take into account guidance and other information provided or published by AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies.  Systems and controls  Your approved systems and controls to mitigate and manage your identified ML/TF risks should also be adequately resourced.  Staff training and communication  It’s also important to communicate these risks to all relevant employees through appropriate documentation and AML/CTF risk awareness training. Document your risk assessment and procedures for mitigating and managing your identified ML/TF risks, including supporting evidence, and how you will monitor effectiveness.  Examples: Applying a risk-based approach effectively Example 1  FinanceCo has assessed that there is significantly higher risk when its customers use cash versus online transactions.  To mitigate and manage this risk, staff have been trained to ask a series of additional questions when processing cash transactions. FinanceCo has also implemented enhanced monitoring alerts to detect unusual activity associated with cash transactions.  Example 2  TransferIt Pty Ltd has updated its risk assessment and determines that transactions sent to a particular south-east Asian country are no longer a high risk.  They make changes to their systems and controls, proportional to the new level of risk, and document the reason for the change and the internal approval process. These changes involve TransferIt removing and adjusting existing monitoring alerts for customers that transact to the country.  Understanding ML/TF risks  ML/TF risks can be broadly understood on two levels:  at the whole-of-reporting entity level in relation to particular customers and business relationships.  The AML/CTF Act and Rules set out a range of measures required for reporting entities to identify, mitigate and manage their ML/TF risk across their businesses. See AUSTRAC’s guidance and insights on risk assessments  In line with your business’s risk assessment, you must apply a range of risk-based systems and controls when dealing with particular customers, including:  procedures to verify your customers’ identity and for ongoing due diligence understanding the nature and purpose of the business relationship with different customer types understanding the control structure of non-individual customers (i.e. underlying beneficial ownership information) understanding risks arising from changes in the nature of the business relationship, control structure, or beneficial ownership of your customers ongoing monitoring of transactions and business relationships with the assessed level of ML/TF risks.

20,Australia AUSTRAC,Collaboration is key to combating trade-based money laundering,,"In simpler times, a business front would suffice to make illegally acquired money appear legitimate. A chain of laundromats did the job for Al Capone and is the origin of the term ‘money laundering’.  Over time, criminals have turned to increasingly sophisticated methods to disguise the origins of dirty money and integrate it into the mainstream economy.  In trade-based money laundering (TBML), criminals take advantage of the size and complexity of international trade to transfer money between parties and evade authorities.  Techniques include mismatching the value of the goods and payment (over- or under-pricing relative to market value, quantity or quality), issuing multiple invoices for a single shipment or sending no goods at all.  Money launderers may also seek to obscure their crime through constructing a network of highly complex trade processes that mingle legitimate with illicit funds and take advantage of governance gaps across jurisdictions.  TBML is big business. The profits of international organised crime have been estimated as 1.5% of global GDP, with more than half of these profits laundered through the global financial system.  Developing countries are particularly vulnerable, where value gaps in reported international trade have been estimated as USD 8.7 trillion over 2008-17, and USD 817.6 billion in 2017 alone. The human consequences are grave, including 40.3 million people forced into slavery worldwide, a quarter of whom are children.  For authorities and the trade financing industry, TBML can be difficult to detect amid the many processes, parties, transactions and jurisdictions. As with any disruption approach, anti-TBML efforts need to be constantly refined to keep up with new and emerging risks posed by criminals seeking to harm the community and profit from their crimes.  Acknowledging that no single body can tackle such challenges, AUSTRAC has been taking a collaborative approach.  We established the Fintel Alliance in 2017, the world’s first private-public partnership of its kind. Fintel Alliance’s 28 members include experts from financial industry, intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and academic and research institutions. Along with improved operational outcomes, members’ capability increases as partners learn from one another and synthesise knowledge.  Fintel Alliance has now formed a TBML working group that includes front line experts from industry and law enforcement to develop indicators and typologies that can be broadened to other jurisdictions and trade types.  The value of this interconnected approach is becoming clear. Better intelligence and information-sharing regarding child sexual exploitation resulted in a 643% increase in suspicious matter reports to AUSTRAC. This supported the detention or arrest of 73 persons and the protection or rescue of 35 victims in 2018-19.   To combat TBML, as with other serious and organised crimes, we need to continue to monitor and prepare for shifts in the risks that criminals may pose to the financial system and community. Timely and quality contributions from industry are crucial for success. As financial crime becomes more complex across the globe, collaboration is a critical foundation to overcome criminal exploitation of our interconnected trade, financial systems and global communities.  New report highlights latest TBML risks and challenges  A joint Financial Action Taskforce (FATF)-Egmont Group project on TBML recently concluded. AUSTRAC led Australia’s input into the project and there were substantial contributions from private and public Fintel Alliance members to the development of the project’s final report.

Your ACIP and ongoing customer due diligence are critical to protecting your business and the community from serious and organised crime.  The updates include new guidance and example scenarios that will help you identify gaps in your customer identification, verification and ongoing customer due diligence processes.  Review your ACIP and ongoing customer due diligence processes:  Customer identification and due diligence overview Enhanced customer due diligence (ECDD) program Transaction monitoring Suspicious transactions. The importance of carrying out ACIP correctly and strong ongoing customer due diligence  An oversight at the account opening stage could allow criminals to take advantage of your business, hurting your reputation and the community over the longer term.  ACIP may involve many different processes depending on the type of customer – from identifying individuals, knowing who the beneficial owners are (if the customer is not an individual), whether the customer or any beneficial owners are politically exposed persons, and the purpose of their relationship with your business.  Ongoing customer due diligence plays a crucial role in identifying, mitigating and managing your risks and should be used to respond to threats posed to your business. Without strong ACIP or ongoing customer due diligence, your business and the community could be at greater risk of serious and organised crime. ",15 April 2021

23,Australia AUSTRAC,Enhanced customer due diligence (ECDD) program,,"Part A of your anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) program must include an enhanced customer due diligence (ECDD) program that documents the actions you take when the money laundering or terrorism financing risk is high.  You must monitor all customers with a view to identifying, mitigating and managing ML/TF risks. The due diligence measures that are appropriate for a particular customer may change over time as the ML/TF risk profile of the customer changes.  Enhanced customer due diligence involves carrying out extra checks on a customer’s identification, collecting additional information and doing additional verification.  Carrying out ECDD allows you to decide whether a suspicious matter should be reported. ECDD plays an important role in detecting, disrupting and preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. It also protects your business or organisation from being exploited for criminal activity.  Suspicious matter reports and ECDD  Submitting a suspicious matter report (SMR) does not manage the ongoing risk of a customer on its own, nor does it alter the fact that a customer is high risk. When a suspicion is formed (and an SMR submitted) about a customer, you also need to apply ECDD.  When to apply your ECDD  You must apply your ECDD in the following high-risk situations.  When you determine through your risk-based systems and controls the money laundering/terrorism risk is high. The service you are asked to provide is for a customer who is (or has a beneficial owner who is) a foreign politically exposed person (PEP). A customer’s suspicious activity or behaviour may lead to you making a suspicious matter report (SMR).

This can be directly (such as through shareholdings) or indirectly (such as through another company’s ownership or through a bank or broker). ‘Controls’ in this case means having the power to make decisions about the entity’s finances and operations. They may exert control through trusts, agreements, arrangements, understandings, policies or practices.  Note that a customer may have more than one beneficial owner.  Your obligations around beneficial owners include:  determining who your customers’ beneficial owners are assessing the level of money laundering/terrorism financing risk your customers’ beneficial owners pose to your business or organisation verifying the identity of your customers’ beneficial owners keeping records of how you identified each beneficial owner and verified their identity.

47,Australia AUSTRAC,Your SMR reporting obligations,,"SMRs are only related to providing a designated service. This includes when you start providing designated services, or when you are asked about providing designated services as part of your normal business activities.  You must submit an SMR if you or anyone in your business or organisation suspects on reasonable grounds that a customer is not who they claim to be, or the designated service relates to any one of the following:  terrorism financing money laundering an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law proceeds of crime tax evasion.  This includes an affiliate of a remittance network provider (RNP), however if the affiliate and the RNP have a written agreement, and the suspect transaction has been made using the RNP’s network, either one can submit the SMR.  You do not have to submit an SMR if you provided the designated service at or through a permanent establishment in a foreign country.  Reasonable grounds for suspicion  You must submit an SMR if you have ‘reasonable grounds’ for suspicion. This means that after considering all the information and circumstances available, a reasonable person would conclude that there is a relevant suspicion and an SMR should be submitted.  If you or anyone in your business or organisation notices something unusual, you must conduct enhanced due diligence checks to determine if you have reasonable grounds for your suspicion.  Once the appropriate person in your business or organisation has completed the checks and forms a suspicion, you must submit an SMR within the required timeframes.  You or your staff, including your AML/CTF compliance officer don’t have to know exactly what criminal activity the customer might be involved in, or where the suspect funds or property came from, to make an SMR.  It’s important to remember that not all unusual customer behaviour is suspicious. Sometimes customers have irregular transaction patterns or account activity. When this happens, you should use enhanced customer due diligence procedures to help you decide if the activity is suspicious and needs to be reported through an SMR.  How to identify suspicious activity  To help you identify suspicious activity and prevent customers using your business or organisation to launder money or finance terrorism, you must have systems and controls in place, including:  ML/TF risk assessment customer identification procedures a transaction monitoring program AML/CTF risk awareness training program for employees  They should be designed to help your staff identify and check suspicious activity or customer behaviour so you can decide whether you need to report it to us.

Revealing this information is an offence that’s punishable by up to two years jail and/or a fine of up to 120 penalty units. Find out more about consequences of not complying.  Your other obligations when you submit an SMR include:  not revealing any information that might reasonably lead a person to conclude that you have formed a suspicion about them or have told AUSTRAC about that suspicion not revealing any requests AUSTRAC or law enforcement agencies make for more information about an SMR.  Once you form a suspicion about a customer, be discreet when seeking further details so they don’t realise you may make, or have already made, an SMR. However, asking the customer for more information, including about their identity or the source or destination of their funds, is not by itself considered ‘tipping off’.  You can’t give information about a specific SMR to any external parties appointed to review your AML/CTF program, even if they are reviewing your SMR obligations.  Doing business with a suspicious customer  You don’t have to end your business relationship or stop providing designated services to a customer because you have formed a suspicion about them. You should use your own risk-assessment policy and procedures to decide whether to continue doing business with them.  If you do decide to end the business relationship, you must not tell the customer that you have formed a suspicion or that you have reported an SMR to us. If you do so, it is called ‘tipping off’ and is against the law.  Exceptions  There are some situations where you are allowed to disclose that you have formed a suspicion about a customer (but not the fact that you have submitted a SMR).  The exceptions to ‘tipping off’ are when:  you are a reporting entity that is a legal practitioner or qualified accountant, and you have suspicions about a client and want to persuade them not to do something illegal you want to get legal advice relating to your suspicion from a legal practitioner you are a member of a designated business group (DBG) with a joint AML/CTF program and need to inform other members of the group of the risks involved in dealing with the customer you are a member of a corporate group and need to tell someone in the group about the risks involved in dealing with the customer you are a remittance network provider (RNP) giving information about the customer to one of your affiliates, or you are an affiliate giving information to your RNP you are an authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) giving customer information to an owner-managed branch of the same ADI you are disclosing information in compliance with a Commonwealth, state or territory law you are disclosing information to an Australian law enforcement body, such as the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission you are informing someone about the operation of counter-terrorism financing sanctions under Part 4 of the Charter of the United Nations Act, e.g. to inform law enforcement or DFAT about the freezing of assets, or to explain to a customer why a transaction prohibited by counter-terrorism sanctions cannot be carried out.

55,Australia AUSTRAC,Suspicious transactions identified by your transaction monitoring systems,,"You must make sure your transaction monitoring systems alert you to unusual, large or complex transactions or patterns of transactions.  What defines a transaction as large or unusual will depend on the size of your business or organisation and the services you offer. It also depends on the types of customers and transaction activities you normally deal with.  Indicators of criminal activity  There are many customer transactions that may indicate your business or organisation is being exploited for money laundering, terrorism financing or other serious crime.  Examples of these indicators include:  gambling proceeds being deposited into foreign bank accounts buying casino chips and cashing them out with no gaming activity associations having multiple accounts under multiple names transactions that don’t match the customer profile high volumes of transactions being made in a short period of time depositing large amounts of cash into company accounts depositing multiple cheques into one bank account purchasing expensive assets, such as property, cars, precious stones and metals, jewellery and bullion using third parties to make wire transfers using an accountant or lawyer to make transactions using cash to buy large amounts of gold regularly selling large amounts of jewellery, gold or precious metals storing large amounts of cash in a safety deposit box cashing bank drafts for foreign currency exchanging large amounts of currency for traveller’s cheques withdrawing large amounts of cash making multiple transactions on the same day from different locations using false or stolen identities to open bank accounts repaying loan balances early or in cash describing frequent transfers of funds as loans from relatives moving funds through different accounts closing insurance policies and requesting payment to a third party sending investment funds to high-risk countries reducing (structuring) the amount of cash deposits or withdrawals to avoid triggering transaction reporting rules.  Read our case studies for more examples of indicators of criminal activity that businesses have recognised and reported to AUSTRAC.  If you are suspicious about a transaction  If your monitoring program identifies suspicious customer transactions or behaviour, you must apply your enhanced customer due diligence and submit a suspicious matter report (SMR) to AUSTRAC.  Identifying a higher ML/TF risk does not necessarily mean that a customer relationship must be terminated, but if you decide to terminate a customer relationship, continue to apply ECDD and OCDD until the termination takes effect. You can consider placing restrictions on the account to prevent further transactions.  You should continue to monitor for new accounts that could be related to the closed accounts. ",29 March 2021

63,Australia AUSTRAC,AUSTRAC overview,,"AUSTRAC is the Australian Government agency responsible for detecting, deterring and disrupting criminal abuse of the financial system to protect the community from serious and organised crime.  Through strong regulation, and enhanced intelligence capabilities, AUSTRAC collects and analyses financial reports and information to generate financial intelligence. This vital information about potential criminals and criminal activity contributes to our national security and law enforcement investigations  For more than 30 years, AUSTRAC has been evolving to address the challenges in a financial system that is rapidly changing and targeted by criminals in complex ways.  Today, AUSTRAC finds itself working in a disrupted financial landscape, with new and emerging technologies changing the way financial services are delivered, in an increasingly globalised economy. These disruptions have created significant changes in the sector and AUSTRAC has adapted to these shifts in how it regulates businesses to disrupt financial crime to protect the community.  As criminals become more sophisticated and develop new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in the Australian financial system, we will continue to evolve and deepen how we work with our reporting population and partners. This is enabled by our highly collaborative approach and specialist work force.  In addition, the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry highlighted the importance of agencies such as AUSTRAC in providing oversight of the financial sector, and supporting entities in meeting their regulatory obligations.

What makes a good SMR?  A good SMR explains clearly and concisely why you think the customer’s behaviour is suspicious. Use your own words and include as many details as possible. For example, if you can’t identify the customer, you might include details about how old they looked, what they were wearing, the colour of their hair etc.  Your grounds for suspicion, including the reasons why you’re submitting an SMR, should follow plain English principles with information structured in a clear and logical way.  For more information about submitting effective SMRs, refer to:  Suspicious matter reporting: reference guide Suspicious matter reporting: checklist Suspicious matter reporting: frequently asked questions Effective suspicious matter reporting: factsheet What your SMR must include  An SMR must include details about your business or organisation and everything you know about:  the suspicious matter the person/organisation it relates to any transactions involved.  For individuals, you must include, if known:  their full name, address and telephone number their date of birth country of citizenship occupation, type of business activity and ABN email address any other name they use a description of the documents or electronic data you used to verify their identity.  If you don’t know someone’s identity, the SMR should instead include:  a description of the person whether you have any video footage or photographs of them their address and email address, if known. Deadlines for submitting an SMR  The SMR reporting deadlines start once the appropriate person in your business or organisation has formed a suspicion, which may be at any time in your business relationship.  A suspicion is only ‘formed’ after the appropriate person in your business or organisation has conducted enhanced due diligence checks and determined that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion.  Remember, your SMR must be submitted within:  24 hours if the suspicion relates to terrorism financing or within 3 business days if the suspicion relates to money laundering or any other offence. What happens after you submit an SMR?  To help with our investigations, we may ask you for more information about an SMR you’ve submitted. Our partner agencies also have the right to ask for further information in some circumstances. We will issue a written notice asking for this information. This might include asking you for further details about the customer or a specific transaction or account. If you don’t provide the information when asked you can be fined.  The SMR you submit is not admissible as evidence in court, but it can be used in criminal proceedings for some AML/CTF Act offences, such as if you tip off a customer or provide false or misleading information.  Penalties for not submitting an SMR  If you submit an SMR late – or don’t submit one when you should – you can be fined up to 20,000 penalty units in the Federal Court of Australia, or 100,000 penalty units if you’re a body corporate.

One of the main focuses for our international engagement is protecting Australia and the Pacific region against money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) threats.  Some of the key threats to our region include corruption, environmental crime, people smuggling and tax evasion. Transnational serious organised crime groups also use the Pacific as a transit hub for drug trafficking.  In April 2020, AUSTRAC created the Pacific Operations team to strengthen our relationships in the region and enhance our response to ML/TF threats in the Pacific.  Our work in the region is part of the Australian government’s ‘Pacific Step-up’ initiative. Pacific Step-up is one of Australia's highest foreign policy priorities, allowing us to better support the regional operational activities of agencies such as the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Border Force.  We also partner with Pacific FIUs to strengthen collaboration and identify and combat ML/TF threats in the South Pacific Island region by:  upgrading IT systems so that analysts have access to the latest and most sophisticated data management and analysis tools providing financial intelligence analysis training collaborating with partner FIUs to help AUSTRAC follow illicit money as it moves within and beyond our region.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made international engagement even more challenging. As a result, we’ve moved many of our activities online to keep up our ongoing support to our friends in the Pacific while also seeking to keep Australia safe.

Fintel Alliance has an established program of work based on targeting priority themes including crimes targeting our most vulnerable community members, exploitation of government revenue, disrupting professional money laundering, and crimes and threats to Australia’s domestic and international interests.  Fintel Alliance partners work together at AUSTRAC’s offices in Sydney and Melbourne, sharing and analysing financial intelligence to investigate and disrupt criminal and terrorist activity.  There are two information-sharing hubs where partners collaborate:  The Operations Hub – a physical space where partners exchange and analyse financial intelligence in close to real time, combining data with tracking tools and best-practice methodologies from their organisations. The Innovation Hub –partners co-design and test new and innovative technology solutions that assist in gathering and analysing financial intelligence at an operational level. They also assess the impact of emerging technologies such as blockchain and digital currency (or cryptocurrency). A day in the life of Fintel Alliance ",11 May 2021
